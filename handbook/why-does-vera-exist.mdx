# Our mission

We help companies speed up deals with automated supplier, compliance and security reviews.

## Why supplier, compliance and security reviews?

To sell into enterprise, you need trust. Trust is the foundation of relationships, which are the building blocks of human society. In a world that is more connected and globalised, where SaaS is becoming increasingly commoditised, it’s human connection and relationships that cannot be _faked_, thus I think that trust has an increasingly crucial role in business-to-business relationships_**\_. \_There is nothing more defensible than relationships and trust. 

More practically, we believe people buy products that **solve a problem** and that **they trust**.

If you're looking for a car, you want to make sure it drives well and has all the accessories and gadgets, but you wouldn’t buy it if it might leave you stranded on a family road trip.

If we make it easy to set, maintain and showcase measures aimed at building trust, then companies can focus on solving problems. 

# Our strategy

1. Provide every tool to speed up the supplier, security and compliance review process
2. Get in first, expand later
3. Enable companies to prioritise their work based on customer requirements

## 1. Provide every tool to speed up the supplier, security and compliance review process

Growth is hard. It already takes a lot of resources for companies to generate new business. Too often, suppliers, security, and compliance slow them down.

The act of answering questions builds trust but doesn’t reduce risk. Answering questions fast gives resources to the sales people to focus on selling, while risk managers can focus on protecting the business, adding tangible value to the business.

## 2. Get in first, expand later

This is a strategic decision for us. We believe that getting in early will allow us to capture more value by offering other solutions to make the company run more efficiently. Reducing our long term customer acquisition costs.

## 3. Enable companies to prioritise their work based on customer requirements

Not understanding customer requirements early creates a fog of war that has a direct negative impact on growth. Compliance and security frameworks are treated as a “rite of passage”. A black box that you “must complete” to target bigger companies.

For example: A customer asks are you SOC 2 Type II compliant? They might not be sure why they are asking besides it being standard. You then google “how to become SOC II compliant” and pay for a one size fits all check-box exercise to be completed as quickly as possible and with the least resources, not addressing the risk but rather the reporting around it.

Instead, we want to give companies visibility over their requirements so they can make smarter decisions and grow quicker.
