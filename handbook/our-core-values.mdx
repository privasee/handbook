## Be a self-guided missile

Everything is achievable. Start with your goal in mind, and work backwards to create a clear, confident plan. Break the challenge into smaller, manageable steps, aligning with the time and resources available. Then move forward with energy and determination, knowing success is within your reach.

## Follow the scientific method

Create data-driven assumptions, create a plan and execute relentlessly with built-in stop cues and self-reflect. Stop cues can be a specific time, event or trigger.

- Times: we set a date when we think it's to re-evaluate.
- Events: if we raise 20m more we need to change the plan.
- Triggers: if a lot of leads come with RFPs we need to reconsider our value prop.

After pausing or finishing, self-reflect.

## Expect a bumpy road

Be optimistic but expect things to not go the way you want. The mindset is that you won’t win if you don’t fail enough, take the failures with a constructive attitude and humour. Expect a bumpy road and don’t let the wins or losses define you, but rather the process.

## Overdeliver

Do more than what is just the requirement. 

It’s the difference between:

- Submit the final document or submit the final document with a document that shows the differences between the final and draft and comments that are easy to digest.
- Giving a candidate a job offer or editing their CV so they see what your goal for them is.
- Creating a loom video to make information digestible instead of just a text update.
- Instead of just highlighting a problem, add an opinionated proposed solution to a problem or comment 

## Don’t work alone

You’re part of a team of smart, high achievers, the collective mind will always be better at solving a problem than a single one. Achieve as much as you can by yourself but then work with others to reduce stress, make better decisions and create buy-in.
