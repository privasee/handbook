# Our mission

**We give companies every tool to build products people trust.**

## **Why Trust? **

Trust is the foundation of relationships which are the building blocks of human society. In a world that is more connected and globalised, where SaaS is becoming increasingly commoditised, it’s human connection and relationships that cannot be _faked_**_, thus I think that trust has an increasingly crucial role in business-to-business relationships_**_. _There is nothing more defensible than relationships and trust. 

More practically, we believe that people buy products that **solve a problem** and **they trust**.

If you're looking for a car, you want to make sure it drives well and has all the accessories and gadgets;  but you wouldn’t buy it if it might leave you stranded on a family road trip.

If we make it easy to set, maintain and showcase measures aimed at building trust, then companies can focus on solving problems.

    We build for people. Companies are just a collection of people with a common goal.

  <Accordion title="Why build tools instead of a service?" icon="sparkles">
    Services rarely give more than a linear return value per unit of time. Software can.

    At Privasee, we are pragmatic technologists who love using technology to solve problems.
