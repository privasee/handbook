# Our mission

We give companies every tool to build products people trust.

## Why Trust?

Trust is the foundation of relationships which are the building blocks of human society. In a world that is more connected and globalised, where SaaS is becoming increasingly commoditised, it's human connection and relationships that cannot be _faked_. There is nothing more defensible than relationships and trust.

More practically, we believe that people buy products that **solve a problem** and **they trust**.

If you're looking for a car, you want to make sure it drives well and has all the accessories and gadgets; but you wouldn't buy it if it might leave you stranded on a family road trip.

If we make it easy to set, maintain and showcase measures aimed at building trust, then companies can focus on solving problems.

# Our strategy

1. Provide every tool to evaluate risks that prevent growth.
2. Get in first, expand later.
3. Enable companies to prioritise their work based on customer requirements.

## Provide every tool to evaluate risks that prevent growth

Growth is hard. Most founders have a great idea and want to get it in front of as many people as possible. But too often, legal, security, and compliance slow them down when they shouldn't. Doing things right should be easy - and companies that cut corners shouldn't get ahead for it.

Risk and growth aren't proportional; pulling one lever too hard can throw the other off balance. Optimising only for growth increases risk while focusing too much on risk mitigation stifles growth. The key to building a fast-scaling, successful business is striking the right balance - moving fast without exposing yourself to unnecessary risk.

## Get in first, expand later

Risk is like a knot in a cable. You tackle it early and it's solved in a few minutes. You ignore it for long and well, you end up with this.

The bigger the company the more complex to understand and undo. We want to get in as early as possible and prevent mistakes before it's too late.

We also think this is a strategic decision for us as SaaS is becoming less defensible. Add that to the fact that companies spend up to 12 months of the contract value to acquire a customer (12 months CAC payback period), and it's clear that owning the relationship with the customer and getting in first is an easy investment that will ensure that you can build a much larger, more efficient organisation down the line.

## Enable companies to prioritise their work based on customer requirements

Compliance and security frameworks are treated as a "rite of passage". Something obscure and misunderstood that you "must complete" to target bigger companies or that is asked of you before working with a specific client.

For example: A customer asks are you SOC 2 Type II compliant? They might not be sure why they are asking besides it being standard. You then google "how to become SOC II compliant" and pay for a check-list of things to be completed as quickly as possible and with the least resource as possible, not addressing the risk but rather the reporting around it.

This turns these frameworks into a one-size-fits-all checkbox exercise that distracts companies and often doesn't tackle real risks. Legal and risk profiles might see the danger but struggle to get buy-in. Sales might see the holes or inefficiencies when asked from customers but struggle to understand and communicate requirements.

Instead, our vision is to help companies understand their requirements first, what they need and why. Then link the existing frameworks and regulations - giving them the tools to prioritise the work based on how much it limits their growth.

In that way, a company working in financial services might need to work on KYC as a first step to business, whereas an AI notetaker might need to polish their DPA and SOC II.
