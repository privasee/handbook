| **Their pain points**                                         | When multiple questionnaires arrive, other work stops. Deals are delayed because key people are busy. Answers take time to find. Dedicated staff are at capacity. Repeated questions cause extra work. Information goes out of date quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
