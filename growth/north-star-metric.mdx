title: 'Our north star metric'
---

The ultimte growth metric we care about is: Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) Growth Rate. Particularly, we measure this monthly.

However, revenue growth is an ouput goal, meaning that it's a consequence of giving value to users for a period of time.

Therefore, we have established a North Star Metric (NSM) that is directly related to value. We believe value is proportional to revenue, so if we're able to improve our ability to give value to customers, our ARR growth rate will follow.
