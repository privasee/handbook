The ultimate growth metric we care about is: [Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) Growth Rate](https://www.metrichq.org/saas/arr-growth-rate/). We track this monthly (most blogs talk about yearly growth rate) using ChartMogul.

However, revenue growth is an output goal, meaning that it's a consequence of giving value to users for some time.

Thus, we have established a North Star Metric (NSM) that is directly related to value. We believe value is proportional to revenue, so if we're able to improve our ability to give value to customers, our ARR growth rate will follow.
