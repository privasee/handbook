# Modals

All of our modals should be standardised to meet with the following criteria:

**Always use a query that modifies the URL**. This allows us to capture events in Posthog without extra dev work and makes it future-proof for AI implementations (we can easily expand the query model for AI to create pre-filled forms for customers).

**Fool proof-modals**. Unless stated otherwise, modals should be fool-proof, meaning cicking outside of it will not close it. By default, the `<AlertDialog>` component should be used with `showCloseIcon`.
